# BaconGameJam08 entry

The theme for this 48 hour game jam is **"Millions of them"**.
This is my entry into this reddit-organized gamejam.

I (try to) blog about the creation and process of this game in this post:
[BaconGameJam 08 at snemanden.com](http://snemanden.com/blog/bacongamejam-08).

The game is written in javascript and uses pixi.js as the rendering engine.
